This project is to demonstrate how multiple linear regression works with my own multiple linear regression class. To demonstrate it, I used an extremely simple dataset of statistics from the website "Stack Overflow" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stackoverflow) to easily predict the number of posts in a thread when given the number of comments and answers. This project includes my own multiple linear regression class with a fit, predict, and score function to mimmick scikit-learn's linear regression class. I have also added in a function to quickly evaluate the RMSE of the data, so you don't have to do it manually in the main script.

I then compare my multiple linear regression class with scikit-learn's to assess its accuracy in the Main.py script, and its results are near identical. This includes the R-squared score, the intercept, the coefficients, and the RMSE.
